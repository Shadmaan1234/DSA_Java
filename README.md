## Overview

DSA_Java provides clear, commented Java code for a range of data structures and algorithms. Each implementation is designed with educational purposes in mind, aiming to help learners grasp the mechanics and applications of these concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different data structures and algorithmic concepts:

- **Arrays and ArrayLists**: Fundamental operations on arrays and usage of ArrayLists.
- **HashMaps**: Examples demonstrating efficient key-value operations using HashMaps.
- **HashSets**: Usage scenarios and operations for storing unique elements with HashSets.
- **LinkedLists**: Operations such as insertion, deletion, and reversal on linked lists.
- **Queues**: Implementations and applications of queue data structures.
- **Stacks**: Implementations and applications of stack data structures (LIFO operations).
- **Trees**: Common algorithms for tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order) and manipulation.

## Getting Started

To begin using the code in this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnab-4/DSA_Java.git
```

Feel free to explore each folder to understand and modify the implementations as needed. Each folder contains its own README.md with additional details specific to that data structure or algorithm.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you have a new data structure or algorithm implementation to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new algorithm: [algorithm name]'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-algorithm`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows the established style and includes appropriate comments for clarity.

## Visual Resources

The **Vault** folder contains helpful visuals, diagrams, or additional resources that aid in understanding the concepts covered in this repository.
